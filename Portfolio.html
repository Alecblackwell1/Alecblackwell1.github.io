					<h2> <b> A Knights Life</h2>
					<a id="taco" href="https://alecblackwell1.github.io/Art%2075%20Stuff/Knight'sLife/Interactive%20Website.html">A Knights Life (Click Me)</a>
						<p>
							"A Knights Life" was my first attempt at creating a website using HTML and CSS. Its inspiration was the choose your own adventure games that are not commonly seen in today's age.
						</p>

					<h2> <b> Html: Your Decisions</h2>
						<a id="taco" href="file:///Users/henryblackwell/Desktop/github/Alecblackwell1.github.io/Art%2075%20Stuff/Project3/Your%20Decisions.html"> Your Decisions (Click Me)</a>
						<p>
							"Your decisions" was inspired by how I felt when I started to realize that I had depression and that I should learn how to deal with it. This was my second attempt at creating an HTML website, its style came from my previous project "A Knights Life".

						<a id="taco" href="https://alecblackwell1.github.io/Art%2075%20Stuff/Final%20Project/Our%20Society.html"> What we want to do (Click Me)</a>

						<p id="what">
							"What we want to do" was created with the intent to show how people struggle with trying to find jobs in this society and how their own self doubt could make their situation worse.
						</p>

					<h2> <b> Sun Drug</h2>
						<a id="taco" href="https://alecblackwell1.github.io/P5%20Stuff/index.html">Sun Drug</a>
						<p id="what">
							"Sun Drug" was a concept that I had during my first semester in college. When I first learned about P5, I had recently learned about the effects of drugs on ones brain in my Health class so I got the inspiration for Sun Drug from that.
