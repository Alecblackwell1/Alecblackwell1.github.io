						<p>
							My name is Henry Aleczander Blackwell, I am a Digital Media Art student at San Jose State University. I spend whatever time I have when I'm not at school, doing homework, or studying playing video games. So a lot of my art work has been influenced by games such as League Of Legends and Overwatch.
								I want my audience to feel intrigued by how abstract and "weird" my art is. My personal favorite art piece that I have created is 3D Mashup project. The effects that Mesher was able to make were very intriguing to me and having the ability form the objects in any way I wanted was really fun to mess around with. My next favorite was the Net Art ptoject because the outcome of the project would always be different but with similar patterns because of the random colors that each object changes to.
								All in all, I really enjoyed my first semester studying Digital media Art and I hope to continue my journey and improve my skills as an artist as well as. I believe I most importantly want to improve on my coding skills.
